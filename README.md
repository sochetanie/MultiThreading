Write an Application that extends the Thread class, call it MyThread.java.  Have your new class accept an integer(i.e. 200) when it is instantiated.  (MyThread mt = new MyThread(200); )
This integer number will be the number of times that this class loops and prints a message.  The message should read  “Thread Running…200”. The 200 would be whatever number is passed into the constructor.  If the number was 300, then the output should read “ Thread Running ….. 300”.  Use a main method to test this class.  In the main method, after starting the Thread,  loop 200 times, and print out “Main Running…”. You do not need to use the sleep() method for this exercise.
